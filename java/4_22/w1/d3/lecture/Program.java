/* What are the four pillars of OOP? */
/*
	Encapsulation
	Inheritance
	Polymorphism
	Abstraction
*/

/* What is encapsulation? */
/*
	The idea of grouping members and methods (variables and functions)
	into an object, with the ability to hide information from an
	end user ( access modifiers / private / public ).
*/

/* What is inheritance? */
/*
	Using the same members and methods from
	one class in another, without having
	to rewrite it all.
*/


/*****************************************************************************/
/* Afternoon Lecture: */
/*****************************************************************************/

/* What is polymorphism? */
/*
	Having many forms. The ability to use a parent class'
	functionality while also being able to change it altogether.
*/

/* What is abstraction? */
/*
	Hiding the fine details about
	how an object performs a task
	in order to make code easier to
	understand
*/

/* What is an interface? */
/*
	Like a recipe, but without the ingredients,
	and only the steps needed in order to create
	the recipe. E.G. blank functions with
	optional default functionality.
*/

/* What is an abstract class? */
/*
	A class which cannot be instantiated or created.
	It is merely a basis for other classes to derive from.
	Mostly used when we need similar properties or functionality
	across different classes, where those different classes perform
	those same tasks differently.

/*****************************************************************************/
/* What we're coding: */

/* An app that lets us specify how our custom data structures should each */
/* be iterated differently based on how they store information internally. */
/* Demonstrates all pillars of OOP in one place. */

/* Goals: */

/* Make an Iterable interface, so that we can have our data structures */
/* abide by a "Iterate()" method */

/* Make an Iterator class that lets us select a data structure to iterate */

/* Do Math Lib example for abstract classes. */
