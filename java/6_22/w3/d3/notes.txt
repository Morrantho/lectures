Announcements - Week 3 Day 3

* You have until Wednesday of next week to take or retake the exam!

* 90% of core assignments must be completed before attempting! ( 9 / 10 for Java )

* You only need an exam code to activate your exam.

* NOTIFY MYSELF OR SPENCER FOR A LIVE GRADE.

* Please complete ALL RED BELT FEATURES before attempting BLACK BELT features.

* You CANNOT receive a black belt if you are missing red belt features.

* Once you've completed all red belt features, ask myself or Spencer for a

	review before moving to the black belt features. This will ensure you will
	
	at least obtain your red belt, should you miss any black belt features.

* Once you've completed black belt features, you can always reupload.

* If you miss the timeframe by a few minutes and are no longer able to upload,

	zip your exam code and end it to Spencer or myself for manual upload.

* You do not need to include a video of your exam progress.

* Please do not share any details about the exam with your fellow students who have not yet taken the exam!

* Please try and start your exam by 11 CST at the latest, so we can try to have all exams graded by the end of

	today.
